# Splitmate Pitch

## 🚀 Mission: Making Expense Management as Simple as Chatting with a Friend

Splitmate is an open-source, AI-powered conversational finance assistant designed to simplify expense management, especially for groups. We're transforming a tedious task into an effortless conversation.

## The Problem: Expense Management is Broken

Current expense tracking apps are cumbersome. They require navigating multiple screens, filling out complex forms, and performing manual calculations for group expenses. This tedious process leads to users abandoning these apps and creates confusion and arguments when splitting bills. The core pain point is that managing expenses feels like a chore.

## Our Solution: A Conversational Approach

Splitmate reimagines expense management with a conversational user interface.

**Instead of this:**
`Open App → Navigate to Add Expense → Fill Form → Select Category → Choose Date → Add Description → Select Split → Calculate Amounts → Save`

**Imagine this:**
`💬 "I spent ₹500 on dinner with Rahul and Meera yesterday"`
`✅ Done! Expense added and split automatically.`

Our AI-powered assistant understands natural language (including Hinglish), parses the details, and handles all the calculations in the background.
