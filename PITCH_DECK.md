### **Slide 5 — How It Works**

**Flow**

1. Login via StackAuth.
2. Share a PhonePe transaction → expense auto-added.
3. SplitMate calculates shares.
4. Chatbot + Analytics show who owes what.
5. One-tap reminders with UPI links.

### **Slide 6 — AI Advantage**

* **OpenAI** + **Quadrant DB** for memory.
* AI understands:

  * “How much do I owe Rahul this month?”
  * “Summarize Goa Trip expenses.”
  * “Add ₹800 cab split equally.”
* Natural, conversational experience.

Do you want me to **design the actual slides (with visuals)** in a **Figma/Canva-style layout**, or should I generate a **flowchart diagram** for Slide 5 (“How It Works”) first?
