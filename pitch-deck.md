# 🚀 SplitMate: Conversational Finance Assistant
## *Making Expense Management as Simple as Chatting with a Friend*

---

## 📊 **Slide 1: The Problem**

### 💸 **Current Expense Management is Broken**

- **🔄 Multiple Screen Navigation**: Users must click through 5+ screens to add a simple expense
- **📱 Complex Forms**: Filling out category, amount, date, description feels like a chore
- **🤝 Group Expense Chaos**: Splitting bills manually leads to confusion and arguments
- **📈 Analytics Overload**: Understanding spending patterns requires data science skills
- **⏰ Time Consuming**: Takes 2-3 minutes to log a single expense

### 🎯 **The Core Pain Point**
> *"Managing expenses feels tedious and users abandon tracking after just a few days"*

---

## 💡 **Slide 2: Our Vision**

### 🗣️ **What if expense management was as simple as talking to a friend?**

**Instead of this:**
```
Open App → Navigate to Add Expense → Fill Form → Select Category → 
Choose Date → Add Description → Select Split → Calculate Amounts → Save
```

**Imagine this:**
```
💬 "I spent ₹500 on dinner with Rahul and Meera yesterday"
✅ Done! Expense added and split automatically.
```

### 🌟 **Our Mission**
*Transform expense management from a tedious task into an effortless conversation*
