Good question 👍 — since your app is **chat + expense + split**, “send reminder” is a key flow. You have a few different options depending on how real you want it to be during the hackathon:

---

## 🔹 1. Hackathon Demo (Quick + Lightweight)

For demo purposes you don’t need a full UPI or SMS gateway. Just show **mock actions**:

* Button: **Send Reminder**
* On click → open a modal with options:

  * **Copy payment link** (mocked `splitmate.app/pay/xyz`)
  * **Share via WhatsApp** → use \[WhatsApp Web deep link]\([https://wa.me/?text=Hey](https://wa.me/?text=Hey)! You still owe me ₹400 for pizza 🍕 — pay here: splitmate.app/pay/xyz).
  * **Share via SMS/Email** → `mailto:?subject=Payment Reminder&body=Hey, please pay ₹400 …`

👉 This works in **Next.js** (web) and will impress judges because it shows “multi-channel reminders.”

## 🔹 2. PWA Share Target (More Realistic)

Since you’re already making this a PWA:

* Use the **Web Share API** (`navigator.share`) →

  ```ts
  navigator.share({
    title: "Expense Reminder",
    text: "Hey Rahul, you still owe me ₹400 for pizza 🍕. Pay here: splitmate.app/pay/xyz",
    url: "https://splitmate.app/pay/xyz"
  })
  ```
* On mobile Chrome/Android, this directly opens the native share sheet (WhatsApp, SMS, Gmail, etc.).

---

## 🔹 3. Advanced (If you want backend integration)

If you want to go one level deeper:

* **Email reminders**: integrate SendGrid/Resend → send email with breakdown and payment link.
* **Push notifications**: use Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for real-time reminders inside the PWA/app.
* **UPI Deep Links**: `upi://pay?pa=rahul@upi&pn=Rahul&am=400&cu=INR` → opens PhonePe/Google Pay directly with prefilled payment.

## 🔹 Suggested Hackathon Pitch

> “Our app lets you remind friends in one tap. You can send reminders via WhatsApp, SMS, Email, or directly generate a UPI payment request. For the hackathon demo we show a WhatsApp/SMS share link, and in production we’ll add push notifications + UPI deep links.”

Do you want me to **add this “Send Reminder” flow into the README features list** (like we did for Share-to-Chat), or should I **mock up the UI code for the reminder modal** right away?
